1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,568
[Speaker 1]Mr. Tripathi.

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,303
[Speaker 1] Mr. Tripathi.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:06,806
[Speaker 1] Relay this.

4
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:10,643
[Speaker 2] Sure, sir.

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,883
[Speaker 2]Skyline 777, we just received information,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,255
[Speaker 2] that Gulf Pacific 747 which couldn't land in Cochin,

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,625
[Speaker 2] has safely landed in Trivandrum airport.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,828
[Speaker 2] Visibility is 3000 meters,

9
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,231
[Speaker 2] weather is clear.

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,300
[Speaker 3] Copy.

11
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,804
[Speaker 4] Sir, Bengaluru is our planned alternative.

12
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:43,343
[Speaker 4] And we need approximately 3300 kgs fuel to reach Bengaluru.

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,013
[Speaker 4] And currently, we have 3900 kgs fuel.

14
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,984
[Speaker 4] I think we should immediately divert to Bengaluru.

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,285
[Speaker 4] It's just safer.

16
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,221
[Speaker 3] Why Bengaluru and not Trivandrum?

17
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,256
[Speaker 3] Quickly.

18
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,758
[Speaker 4] Because the distance between Trivandrum and Cochin

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,627
[Speaker 4] is only 127 nautical miles.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,462
[Speaker 4] If Cochin has bad weather,

21
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,165
[Speaker 4] chances are the Trivandrum's weather could be equally bad.

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,869
[Speaker 3] Never go to a place where your thought doesn't reach before you.

23
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,873
[Speaker 3] Get Trivandrum's weather report again.

24
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,648
[Speaker 4] Cochin, Skyline 777 requesting Trivandrum weather details.

25
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,953
[Speaker 2] Skyline 777, visibility in Trivandrum is 3000 meters...

26
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,760
[Speaker 2] Clouds at 1500 feet.

27
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,830
[Speaker 2] I repeat, clouds at 1500 feet.

28
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,334
[Speaker 3] Redesignate alternate to Trivandrum.

29
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,602
[Speaker 4] But, sir...

30
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,536
[Speaker 3] Look.

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,072
[Speaker 3] If we fly to Trivandrum instead of Bengaluru,

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,640
[Speaker 3] then we'll save fuel.

33
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,743
[Speaker 3] With the extra fuel, we can attempt another landing here.

34
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,314
[Speaker 4] I don't have a good feeling about this, sir.

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,550
[Speaker 3] At 35000 feet above the ground,

36
00:01:58,918 --> 00:01:59,886
[Speaker 3] calculations count not feelings.
