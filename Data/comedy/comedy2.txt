1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:09,100
[Speaker 1] Let go.
[Speaker 2]- Exactly...let go.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,766
[Speaker 1] Gopu, my fingers have surrounded the fritter from all sides.

3
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,566
[Speaker 2] And, my fingers...

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:22,333
[Speaker 2]...have surrounded your fingers from all sides.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,166
[Speaker 4]Don't be scared, Madhav.

6
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,466
[Speaker 4]Let go, Gopu.

7
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:30,900
[Speaker 4]Otherwise...I'll turn off the lights.

8
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,800
[Speaker 3]Don't be scared, Gopu.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,933
[Speaker 3]If you turn off the light, I have a candle.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,900
[Lucky]Oh shit

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,033
[Speaker 3] Even if we've to go over your dead bodies...

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,333

[Speaker 3]...this fritter will be ours.
[Speaker 5]- What is this?

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,266
[Speaker 5] You guys are fighting over a fritter.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,033
[Speaker 3] This is not just about one fritter.

15
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,300
[Speaker 3] It's about the sauce too!

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,633
[Speaker 1] Let go, Gopu.
[Speaker 2] - Let go. Let go!

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
[Speaker 3] Oh sh**

18
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,533
[Speaker 4] Gopu.

19
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:17,833
[Speaker 4] Gopu Ching.

20
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:21,600
[Speaker 4] I love Desi Chinese...
[Speaker 5] - Laxman... Behave yourself.

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,133
[Speaker 4] ...with my fritter.
