00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,827
[Speaker 2] You're not going to change.

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,991
[Speaker 1] There's no chance.

00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,051
[Speaker 1] I don't want these friendly hugs...

10
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:27,532
[Speaker 1] ...if you want to kiss me, then do that.
