1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,750
[Speaker 1] Welcome.

2
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:03,625
[Speaker 1] Welcome to your dream home.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,666
[Speaker 1] Look.

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,375
[Speaker 1] German modular kitchen.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,291
[Speaker 1] Royal mahogany wooden flooring.

6
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,250
[Speaker 1] And handmade artefacts from around the world.

7
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,625
[Speaker 2] All that is fine,

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,625
[Speaker 2] but these artefacts have to go.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,500
[Speaker 1] Ma'am, sir, these are rare antique pieces.

10
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,000
[Speaker 2] Yeah, but they look so cheap.

11
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,625
[Speaker 2] Babe, guess the previous owner had no taste at all.

12
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,041
[Speaker 3] Yeah, sweetheart.

13
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:32,750
[Speaker 3] Not just his taste,

14
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,041
[Speaker 3] his sense of Vaastu was also pretty bad.

15
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,875
[Speaker 3] This door should've been facing southeast instead of southwest.

16
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,875
[Speaker 3] No wonder he went bankrupt.

17
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,541
[Speaker 2] Oh my, God!

18
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,500
[Speaker 1] What happened, ma'am?

19
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,625
[Speaker 2] What happened?

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,166
[Speaker 2] Look at the colour of the sofa.

21
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
[Speaker 2] Baby, people are right.

22
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,500
[Speaker 2] You can buy a house with money but not taste.

23
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,416
[Speaker 2] Excuse me.

24
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,875
[Speaker 2] This sofa has to go.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,041
[Speaker 2]This has to go.

26
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,750
[Speaker 2] This...has to go.

27
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,250
[Speaker 2] This...definitely has to go.

28
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,125
[Speaker 2] The house is okay.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,500
[Speaker 2] We'll let you know.

30
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,875
[Speaker 3] Baby, I'll be right back.

31
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,750
[Speaker 3] Bro, listen to me.

32
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,125
[Speaker 3] I heard that the previous owner is pretty desperate to sell the place.

33
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,416
[Speaker 3] Because that scum's gone bankrupt.

34
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,125
[Speaker 3] Ohh...

35
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,750
[Speaker 3] Look bro, if you can get me this place at a cheaper rate,

36
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,125
[Speaker 3] I'll give you an extra commission.

37
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,291
[Speaker 3] Five per cent.

38
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,500
[Speaker 1]- Really?
[Speaker 3] Really.

39
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,000
[Speaker 3] Five per cent.
[Speaker 1] Five per cent?

40
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,250
[Speaker 1] Wow!

41
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,875
[Speaker 1] - Hey, nice car, bro.
[Speaker 3] - Yeah.

42
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,500
[Speaker 1] But doesn't the colour look too cheap?

43
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,166
[Speaker 3] Cheap? No.

44
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,416
[Speaker 1] Wait a second.

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,416
[Speaker 2] What's he doing?

46
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,208
[Speaker 1] This colour...has to go.
