1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,250
[Speaker 1] Here is good.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,291
[Speaker 1] Okay, then. Bye.

3
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:04,416
[Speaker 2] Listen!

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,375
[Speaker 2] Enough of dating.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,916
[Speaker 2] Let's get married.

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,125
[Speaker 1] What?

7
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,416
[Speaker 1] Is that how you propose to a girl?

8
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,750
[Speaker 1] You're so so unromantic, really!

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,541
[Speaker 1] - Stop fooling around.
[Speaker 2] - Hold on.

10
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,416
[Speaker 2] I'd never fool around with you, Dimple.

11
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,791
[Speaker 2] Hey Buddy! What's the matter?

12
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,291
[Speaker 2] Run along! Lollipop, scoot!

13
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,416
[Speaker 1] Stop the drama. So many people around, can't you see?

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,750
[Speaker 2] I can't see anything...

15
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,041
[Speaker 2] other than the life I want to spend with you.

16
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,250
[Speaker 2] You know everything about me by now.

17
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,916
[Speaker 2] Whatever I am.

18
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,166
[Speaker 2] I really love you.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,000
[Speaker 2] Look Dimple, I'm a simple lad from Palampur.

20
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,041
[Speaker 2] Please say yes?

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,875
[Speaker 2] Quick, there's a stone digging into my knee!

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,041
[Speaker 1] Yes!

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,041
[Speaker 1] Yes, I'll marry you.

24
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,750
[Speaker 2] I knew it. I was pointlessly stressed.

25
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,791
[Speaker 2] You said I'm booked, right?

26
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,250
[Speaker 2] Thought I'll check once.
