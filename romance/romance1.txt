1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:01,757
[Speaker 1] Why aren't you married?

2
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:03,965
[Speaker 2] I really want to...

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,695
[Speaker 2] ...but haven't found that spark in anyone yet.

4
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:10,324
[Speaker 2] Tell me something.

5
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:15,132
[Speaker 2] How come a pretty girl like you became a wrestler?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,783
[Speaker 1] Why?

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,563
[Speaker 1] Do girl wrestlers have horns on their heads?

8
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,610
[Speaker 2] I didn't mean that.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,270
[Speaker 2] What I'm saying is...

10
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:26,982
[Speaker 2] ...sports like wrestling have been for men in our society.

11
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:28,726
[Speaker 2]- Girls are usually...
[Speaker 1] - Usually what?

12
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:32,487
[Speaker 1] Born to be tied to a pillar,like cattle?

13
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,252
[Speaker 1] I started wrestling to change that idea.

14
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,140
[Speaker 1] You know why I fight men in the arena?

15
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:41,315
[Speaker 1] Because your society keeps...

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:45,039
[Speaker 1] ...women caged behind veils from birth to death.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,420
[Speaker 1] Your society doesn't get this simple fact...

18
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,201
[Speaker 1] ...if you kill daughters, how will your sons find brides?

19
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:53,715
[Speaker 1] Even my father wanted a son.

20
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,062
[Speaker 1] He wanted him to be a wrestler.

21
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:57,873
[Speaker 1] Who was born? Me.

22
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:00,807
[Speaker 1] My mother passed away soon after I was born.

23
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,290
[Speaker 1] But my father, he's a caring man.

24
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:07,652
[Speaker 1] He brought me up like a son, sent me to a Delhi college.

25
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,647
[Speaker 1] Nurtured my dreams like his own.

26
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:12,409
[Speaker 1] I could've stayed in Delhi...

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,156
[Speaker 1] ...but I returned to my roots.

28
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:16,920
[Speaker 1] Just watch! The day I win a medal...

29
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,457
[Speaker 1] ...all Haryana will be known for its Aarfa.

30
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:22,353
[Speaker 1] So watch out!

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,662
[Speaker 1] Keep your manhood tucked away.

32
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,554
[Speaker 1] Times are changing.

33
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:29,643
[Speaker 1] Daughters are on the move.

34
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:33,026
[Speaker 1] They'll slam you down so hard, you'll have no idea what hit you.

35
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:35,483
[Speaker 1] Why are you smiling?

36
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:37,874
[Speaker 2] You remind me of Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi.

37
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,632
[Speaker 2] You're modern from the outside.

38
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,887
[Speaker 2] A simple Indian girl on the inside.

39
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:44,628
[Speaker 2] I'm touched.
